		<h2>Panel paintings</h2>
		<p>There are early evidences of Giotto&#39;s panel painting. These panels were executed around 1300 and they betray signs of his having studied contemporary Florentine sculpture. In comparison with his earlier works, the better development of space and more logical use of consistent perspective are new to all later panels. He received numerous commissions for altarpieces that he executed with his workshop. Both works by his atelier and by pupils, and those executed by his own hand, testify to its activities. However, the majority of panel paintings can no longer be seen in their original context. They were for the most part taken to pieces, and the few individual pieces that remain are scattered around the museums of the world.</p>

				<h3>Crucifix</h3>
				<p>In contrast to earlier representations of Christ on the Cross, such as those by his teacher Cimabue, Giotto emphasizes the earthly heaviness of the body: the head sinks deeply forward and the almost plump body sags. The human side of the Son of God is made clear. Mary and John look down sorrowfully from the horizontal ends of the cross at the dead Lord.</p>

				<p>This, probably Giotto&#39;s earliest surviving work, is the largest and most ambitious of the shaped panels of Christ on the cross painted by Giotto. Although his limited anatomical knowledge prevented him attaining the realism of his later crucifixes (in Padua and Rimini), Giotto&#39;s break with Byzantine tradition is clear. This can be seen from the natural pose, the sense of real weight in the way Christ&#39;s body so painfully hangs, the basic simplicity of the loin-cloth, and the realism of the two feet fixed with a single nail.</p>
