		<h2 class="toNav">The Church of San Francesco at Assisi</h2>
		<p>San Francesco at Assisi consists of two superimposed churches, upper and lower churches. The first stone of the Lower Basilica was laid by Pope Gregory IX the day after the canonisation of St Francis, on July 17th 1228. Two years later the saint&#39;s body, that had been resting in the church of San Giorgio was brought here in secret for fear of looting by tomb raiders and buried in the unfinished church. No date has been recorded concerning the start of works on the Upper Basilica, but it must have been after the abdication from the order of Brother Elia in 1239, who had hitherto directed the works on the Romanesque Lower Basilica. Both churches were consecrated by Pope Innocent IV in 1253.&nbsp;</p>
		<h2 class="toNav">Giotto's frescoes in the Upper Church of San Francesco</h2>
		<p>Giotto began his apprenticeship with Cimabue between the ages of ten and fourteen. A trip to Rome presumably rounded off the young painter&#39;s training, after which he followed his master to what was at that time the largest &quot;building site&quot; in Italy, the church of San Francesco in Assisi.</p>
		<p>There, Cimabue was in charge of the decoration of the newly erected Upper Church. When he left Assisi to fulfil other obligations, several of his assistants and journeymen, including Giotto, stayed behind. At the same time, Roman painters, led by Jacopo Torriti, arrived in Assisi, so that several studio groups were working alongside one another. A short time later, Giotto became the independent leader of a workshop, and the Franciscan order assigned him the task of continuing with the decoration.&nbsp;</p>

				<h3 class="toNav">Legend of St Francis: 1. Homage of a Simple Man</h3>
				<p>This is the first of the twenty-eight scenes (twenty-five of which were painted by Giotto) of the Legend of Saint Francis but this was painted probably last.</p>

				<p>A simple man spreads out his cloak before the young nobleman. He alone recognizes that Francis deserves such an honour. While Francis receives the tribute with a terse gesture, the other bystanders react with a lack of understanding. The scene of the action is clearly established, for the temple, which marks the distance between the main protagonists, is the Minerva Temple in Assisi, which can still be seen today.</p>

				<h3 class="toNav">Legend of St Francis: 2. St Francis Giving his Mantle to a Poor Man</h3>
				<p>This is the second of the twenty-eight scenes (twenty-five of which were painted by Giotto) of the Legend of Saint Francis but this was painted first, while the first scene was the last. A stylistic difference between the first two scenes can be observed.</p>

				<p>Francis hands his valuable golden cloak to an impoverished citizen. The scene takes place in front of two rocky hills, on whose peaks two very different types of architecture rise up - the world of the city and of the cloister confront one another here. The descending slopes meet behind the figure of the saint, emphasizing his position in the picture, as well as characterizing his situation in life: this is a first indication that the saint will decide to lead a secluded life of poverty.</p>
